on the final day ofpridemonth, here’s my promise to you: if i have the honor of being elected, i will be the most pro-equality president in our nation’s history. lgbtq+ rights are human rightsand we can't rest until everyone is treated with dignity and respect under the law.
we’re facing a serious threatand we need to meet it together as one country. but this president gives us no direction and actively pits us against one another. we can't continue on like this
if i’m elected, i’ll immediately reach out to dr. fauci and ask him to continue his incredible service to our country. i’ll have the nation’s top medical experts and scientists ready to advise our response on day oneand i'll actually listen to them.
