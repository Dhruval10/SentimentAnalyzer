On the final day of PrideMonth here’s my promise to you If I have the honor of being elected I will be the most pro-equality president in our nation’s history LGBTQ rights are human rights and we can't rest until everyone is treated with dignity and respect under the law.
We’re facing a serious threat and we need to meet it together as one country But this President gives us no direction and actively pits us against one another We can't continue on like this.pic.twitter.com/LA8OJ86Nnk
