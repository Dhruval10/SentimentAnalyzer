People are really confused as to why life hasn’t changed much in the U.S. regarding the virus. There are schools closed and events being cancelled, but you have to understand how much the U.S. economy is tied to the rest of the world. Remember the 2008 recession?
Isn't this Obama's economy?
I’m pretty sure it’s gonna get a lot worse here before it calms down. Yes the seriousness of the actual virus is media inflated but the damage it’s doing on the economy in places like Italy will be horrific.
The market has been ready to burst for a long time but Trump had to build up our domestic economy first before he could allow the pin to pop it. It is now more safe for the market to collapse because the DS doesn't have money to buy it all back. Virus quarantine make arrests EZ.

Literally everywhere! I’ve seen premium economy tickets to T&T and Barbados for like £450... premium economy you know!!!!
Very clever of the CCP to make the global economy dependent upon them. Chinese goods are the drug and we are the addicts.

@ SenSchumer is not a good person. He lies about everything. These people will do anything to make Trump look bad. Tank the economy. Cause panic. They do not care about America or Americans, just their own power.

I wonder if Bernie has curtailed his campaign and is staying away from crowds.Sic. I wonder if he has been tested for the Wuhan virus ?It’s as fake as he is.He’s been in politics for 40 years and has never done anything to stimulate our economy.But,he has enriched himself.

It’s not surprising if you look at his record. How many of his businesses went bankrupt & contractors/ workers got screwed? Obama handed him a healthy economy on the rise & just like DJT’s dad bailed him out, so will a Democratic administration. # VoteBlueNoMatterWhohttps://twitter.com/brhodes/status/1236837879101263872 …
I’m sorry but... NO ONE GIVES A FUCK ABOUT THE ECONOMY RIGHT NOW. TAKE YOU DAMN TAX CUT AND BUY SOME TESTING KITS.
The MSM is inciting a panic over # COVID2019 /coronavirus/Wuhan. They MUST be held accountable for the damage they are inflicting on society, the American public and the economy. If not, they will continue to operate in direct contradiction to our interests @ realDonaldTrump

Yup. Killing the economy. The biggest platform Trump had. Sounds suspicious to me.
Stop doing what you people who really thought tax cuts and big business breaks are more important to an economy than honesty and competency elected him to do? Why would he stop? Look where being a dangerous, lying fool got him.
I imagine some do. Big investors try to scare off small investors. I never time the market. If the U.S. makes it we'll do fine. If it doesn't - it won't matter. Business and industry drive America and so, they tend to take care of that part of the economy.

Communists support slowly declining but polls often understate it and shouldn’t read too much into one poll - if/when they stop backing ANO and economy gets worse they may also get small boost. Don’t bet against them being in next parl.
You just don’t get how this works do you? Putin is trying to tank the economy while it’s already suffering from coronavirus fears and of course side with Putin.
I have to ask, is this virus another ploy from the democrats to make economy slow so they can try and slither their way to the White House? I do not put anything past those snakes. Isn’t it strange how we get major viruses in an election year!

Sec of Health Azar comments on economy, Econonic Adviser Kudlow comments on health. Role reversal. You’re both mixed up and neither qualified to lead even if you’re in the right lane.

People, like you, who place the needs of the individual over the needs of the many. You don't care who gets infected. People without resistance could die, but as long as other families get to travel to see each other & the economy stays buoyant who cares, right?

Stop telling me that things are being based on the presidents directives things are rosy.....what exactly is the task force doing....why is trump talking about the economy......health of the American people is MORE important...stop the BS
For the more dim witted among us: “In economics, a banana republic is a country with an economy of state capitalism, whereby the country is operated as a private commercial enterprise for the exclusive profit of the ruling class. “ Perfect description of Canada under the Libs.
Is the payroll tax cut a good idea in your opinion? Will it stimulate the economy?
